### And Update md file function
> .md picture organizer. Use with Typora; the win series has not been tested and is fresh! Only for personal Java technology learning tools, please do not use it illegally!
There are two main functions: 
> 1. Compress all screenshots and generate md files in the order of modification time;
> 2. Download the internet picture links in all the md files in the md directory to the local and update the picture references or the archive of local pictures;
### Note: 
> The first run with a large amount of pictures may be slower, and subsequent runs have been optimized to update all md file picture references within 4ms;
### Application: 
> 1. The md picture file generated after the screenshot is easy to save and browse, and it is maintenance-free after finishing;
> 2. The content of the copy of the webpage can be recorded as you like, and the program can be run directly in the later period to save time and worry;
